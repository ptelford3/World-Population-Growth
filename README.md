# World-Population-Growth
This is an extra credit project that I completed based on a lab that I completed in a previous Data Science course. The previous course used a custom library so, I recoded it using the standard libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. 
I also included some data, interpretations, and explanations of my own.
All datasets were obtained from the Pew Research Center and Gapminder.
